'''--- Using "random" ---Let's write a simple function that will help organise lotteries. The function will generate a list of random numbers (to simulate lottery tickets), and it will also choose one number from the generated list (to simulate the winning ticket).Write a function named generate_tickets that will accept two integer arguments: ticket_count and max_number. The function should return a tuple with exactly two elements:    first element: a list of random unique integer numbers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to max_number (exclusive); the number of elements is provided in the ticket_count argument    second element: one random element from the generated list of numbersCalling generate_tickets(5, 10) should generate 5 random unique integers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive). An example return value for this invocation could be:([2, 8, 9, 3, 0], 8)In this case, the random numbers are: 2, 8, 9, 3, 0. The winning number is 8.Note: You can assume that the arguments of the function are always correct (i.e. you always get two correct integers as the input arguments).'''# Import the required module'''import randomdef generate_tickets(number_of_tickets, max_number):    # Generate a list of unique random numbers (lottery tickets)    lottery_tickets = random.sample(range(0, max_number), number_of_tickets)    # Choose one random number from the generated list (winning ticket)    winning_ticket = random.choice(lottery_tickets)    # Return the list of tickets and the winning ticket as a tuple    return (lottery_tickets, winning_ticket)'''import randomdef generate_tickets(ticket_count, max_number):    generate_tupple = random.sample(range(0, max_number), ticket_count)    winner_ticket = random.choice(generate_tupple)    return (generate_tupple, winner_ticket)
